A simple app to test first react concepts without using the CRA

![](src/assets/app-preview.png)

## What I've learned

- I had a good understanding of how to structure my apps with webpack setup
- I use a lot of React fundamentals for building all components

## How to test this implementation

In the project directory, you can run:

Installing with:

```sh
yarn
```

Start in development mode:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.
